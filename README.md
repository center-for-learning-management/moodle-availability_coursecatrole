moodle-availability_coursecatrole
========================

This plugin allows to restrict access to activities, resources and sections based on a course category role.


Requirements
------------

This plugin requires Moodle 3.5+


Motivation for this plugin
--------------------------

If your teachers want to restrict activities / resources / sections in their course to a subset of the course participants and these course participants share a common role in any course category above the course, this plugin is for you.

Have a look at an example:

* You have a coursecategory role for all teachers, but within your particular course, they are not enrolled as teachers
* You have courses with guest access, but only users with a coursecategory role are allowed to see certain resources, WITHOUT being enrolled to that course.


Installation
------------

Install the plugin like any other plugin to folder
/availability/condition/coursecatrole

See http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_plugins for details on installing Moodle plugins


Usage & Settings
----------------

After installing the plugin, you need to select which coursecategory roles are visible to end users.
